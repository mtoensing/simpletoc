Adds a custom "table of contents" Gutenberg block.

== Description ==

In Gutenberg, add a block and search for "SimpleTOC" or just "TOC". You need to save your post before you add the block. It works by parsing the post content and retrieving the heading blocks and creates a new dynamic block with a list of links to the headings.

* Designed for Gutenberg.
* Compatible with AMP plugins.
* Minimal and valid HTML output.
* Inherits the style of your theme.
* Control the maximum depth of the headings.
* SEO friendly: Disable the h2 heading of the TOC block and add your own.
* No javascript or css added.
* Comes with English, French, Spanish, German, and Brazilian Portuguese translations.
* Rank Math support.
